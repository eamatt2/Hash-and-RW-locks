# PA-2-Concurrent-Hash-Table

This is the link to the github repository that contains the code for this project 

Below are the chats with AI that we used to gain some of the code in the repository

Overall this assignment was a lot easier to come up with prompts than the previous assignment. I think that the AI model was able to figure out the use of the hashtable and locks easier than coming up with the code for a scheduling system. We ran into less compilation errors and incorrect code than we did on the first PA, and the errors that we did run into were easier to fix.
